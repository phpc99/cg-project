# Features

- Developed a fully interactive 3D scene using OpenGL and GLSL shaders;
- Implemented a movable first-person camera, allowing the player to walk, rotate, and explore the 3D environment;
- Designed and rendered 3D models such as terrain, objects, and environmental elements;
- Applied lighting and shading techniques, including ambient, diffuse, and specular components for realistic illumination;
- Used texturing and material mapping to enhance visual detail and realism across scene elements;
- Integrated animation and transformations, enabling dynamic movement of objects within the environment;
- Implemented user input handling via keyboard and mouse for navigation and interaction;
- Utilized depth testing, culling, and projection matrices to ensure correct rendering and perspective;
- Organized the rendering pipeline with modular scene management, separating shaders, models, and input logic;
- Focused on performance optimization and smooth frame updates for an engaging real-time experience.
